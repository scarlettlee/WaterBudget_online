A test program for water cycle
The process to compute: 
1. BCC: Close water balance components with budget component closure methods PR, CKF, MCL, and MSD
2. closeMergedComponents: Compute closed components as reference values
3. redistribute: Compute outliers and overlyAdjusted values, and then redistribute the residual
4. compareMethods_stats: Compute statistical indicators RMSE, Correlation Coefficient (CC), PBIAS, etc.
